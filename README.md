# BioSim
An admittedly crude population genetics simulation written in Python.
Simulates behavior of a genotype of some trait over the course of n generations;
specifically, how the simulation parameters of H(i.e. the dominance coefficient) and S(i.e. the selection coefficient(1)
affect genotype frequencies in a population over the course of generations.
